If you\nanswer yes to any of these questions, then RSS feeds are the solution for you!\n\nThere is one problem i didn't mention...\n\nRSS feeds are an old technology straight from the 90s, and because of that most\nRSS readers and managers look like they are from the same era.\n\nThat's why i made Easy RSS! The RSS manager for the common internet denizen!\nThis stylish and modern RSS manager takes all the simplicity of the RSS format,\nand incorporates it into a modern and stylish design to create an easy to use\nbut still powerful piece of software.\n\nEasy RSS includes features such as:\n\n    Synchronizing your YouTube subscriptions, so you no longer have to\n    worry about a spooky algorithm controlling what you see.\n    Importing and exporting your feeds to and from other RSS readers, so\n    you can easily adopt Easy RSS, or leave for another RSS reader if you feel\n    like it (altough I shouldn't tell you that if I want a higher\n    usercount).\n    A simple and easy to understand modern UI that makes sure you are never\n    lost in settings pages and Windows XP-esque dialogs\n","screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/213/213720.png?modified=1622133964","width":366,"height":210,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/213/213720.jpg?modified=1622133964","thumbnailWidth":366,"thumbnailHeight":210,"caption":"With Easy RSS, you can import any feeds found in the current tab"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/213/213721.png?modified=1622133965","width":726,"height":229,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/213/213721.jpg?modified=1622133965","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":168,"caption":"This popup is kind of empty, right?

To do so, simply visit our project on the WebLate hosted instance, create an account and either select an existing language or add a new one to get going. Thanks for helping out!\n\n(Alternatively you may submit a merge request on GitLab with the updated translation files or send me the translations using the “Support E-mail”-Address.)\n\n– Getting Help\nFound a bug or want a new feature? Please use the GitLab issue tracker or write an e-mail to submit these. I am not notified of your message content if you just leave a comment.\n\nPlease note however that “User-Agent Switcher” is mostly in maintenance-only mode now and new features will not be added by me (the primary author, ntninja) anymore. I'm still open for patches from the community however.\n\n– Watching it work\nIf you want to watch User-Agent Switcher work, there are a few things you could try:\n\n    Use a web service (such as UserAgentString.com) to see your currently sent User-Agent header.\n    Use the built-in Network Analyzer (Ctrl-Shift-Q) to view the User-Agent header.\n    Enter navigator.userAgent into the Scripting Console (Ctrl-Shift-K) to view the client-side User-Agent value.\n\n\n– Frequently Asked Questions\n\n    Why doesn't the extension work on this very site (Mozilla/Firefox Add-ons)?\n\n    To find out more about why these restrictions exist and how disable them if you must, please take a look at the following blog article: https://ninetailed.ninja/extensions-modify-mozilla-sites.html\n\n    (This information was moved from this extension's description to an external source, since a Mozilla reviewer felt that suggesting changes like the one proposed in the linked article are not acceptable for the listing of sandboxed browser extension.)\n    Why is the extension file so large (4 MiB) compared to others?\n\n    In order to provide almost perfect emulation of User-Agent values, User Agent-Switcher bundles a stripped-down version of BrowsCap. This allows us to derive all relevant JavaScript navigator.* browser/OS identification values from just a single value: The User-Agent value you enter (and a bit of magic behind the scenes). Other extensions with a similarly complete level of emulation used to store all these values in huge tables along with the User-Agent value itself, making it very hard to add new entries.\n\n    Doing this kind of emulation without using BrowsCap would be extremely hard for us, as there are only few rules regarding the structure of User-Agent strings and the most interesting part end up in the extremely browser-specific comment section of the string. As such, we consider these extra 3MiB+ of data shipped with the extension a fair price to pay for having almost perfect out-of-the-box emulation of all these values with no extra user configuration required.\n\n    And yes, the BrowsCap data is here to stay and if you cannot cope with the extra size this causes please kindly download a different extension and don't down-vote. Other people appreciate this decision even if you don't.\n    Can this extension be installed on Firefox for Android?\n\n    Yes! Mozilla has lifted the custom extension ban and this extension should finally work out-of-the-box again now!\n\n    For the previous situation regarding Firefox for Android 69-112, see https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2020/02/11/faq-for-extension-support-in-new-firefox-for-android/ for the original rationale and https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2020/09/29/expanded-extension-support-in-firefox-for-android-nightly/ for the workaround on Nightly/Beta/F-Droid builds.","screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/187/187816.png?modified=1622132699","width":341,"height":525,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/187/187816.jpg?modified=1622132699","thumbnailWidth":260,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Icon with Popup Menu"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/187/187814.png?modified=1622132699","width":299,"height":525,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/187/187814.jpg?modified=1622132699","thumbnailWidth":228,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Random User-Agent Mode"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/187/187817.png?modified=1622132700","width":700,"height":408,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/187/187817.jpg?modified=1622132700","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":311,"caption":"Preferences (Table Mode)"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/187/187818.png?modified=1622132700","width":700,"height":408,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/187/187818.jpg?modified=1622132700","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":311,"caption":"Preferences (Text Mode)"}],"homepageURL":"https://gitlab.com/ntninja/user-agent-switcher","supportURL":"https://gitlab.com/ntninja/user-agent-switcher/issues","contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.3817,"reviewCount":237,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/uaswitcher/reviews/","weeklyDownloads":1522,"amoListingURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/uaswitcher/","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/4449854/uaswitcher-1.4.89.xpi","updateDate":1741693366000},{"id":"{a6c4a591-f1b2-4f03-b3ff-767e5bedf4e7}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/853/853731-32.png?modified=a1617cd0","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/853/853731-64.png?modified=a1617cd0","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/853/853731-128.png?modified=a1617cd0"},"type":"extension","name":"User-Agent Switcher and Manager","version":"0.5.0","creator":{"name":"Ray","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/13129494/"},"developers":[],"description":"Spoof websites trying to gather information about your web navigation—like your browser type and operating system—to deliver distinct content you may not want.","fullDescription":"Usage example: You can alter your user-agent string to indicate you’re on a mobile device if you prefer seeing mobile versions of sites so they load quicker.\n\n--\n\nThis extension allows you to spoof your browser \"user-agent\" string to a custom designation, making it impossible for websites to know specific details about your browsing arrangement.\n\nOverviews:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aVFxvF3N_E\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M6_Zc4o1MQ\n\nNotes:\n1.
